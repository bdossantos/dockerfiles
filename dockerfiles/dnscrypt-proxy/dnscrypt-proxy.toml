# Cisco servers currently cannot handle queries larger than 1472 bytes, and don't
# truncate reponses larger than questions as expected by the DNSCrypt protocol.
# This prevents large responses from being received, and breaks relaying.
# A workaround for the first issue will be applied to servers in list below.
# Do not change that list until the bugs are fixed server-side.
